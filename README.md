# Login_In-Automation
Through this python code you can automate login forms
This Python code uses the Selenium library to automate a web browsing task. The task consists of logging in to a website using a username and password.

First, the necessary modules are imported: webdriver from Selenium, Options from selenium.webdriver.chrome.options, and By from selenium.webdriver.common.by.

Then, an instance of Chrome is opened with options specified to run without a sandbox and disable the use of the shared memory segment. This can help to avoid errors when running Chrome in a virtual environment.

Next, the program uses the find_element() method to locate the username and password fields on the login page by their HTML IDs. The send_keys() method is then used to enter the username and password into the respective fields.

Finally, the program locates the submit button on the page and clicks it with the click() method. After the login is submitted, the quit() method is used to close the Chrome instance.

Overall, this code automates the process of logging in to a website using Selenium and Chrome.
